This is a small 2D game that was done by using minilibx. The goal was to be able to render different maps, be able to find out if the map has a path so that the player can reach all collectibles and exit and make sure player cannot walk over walls.

First the program validates the given map and makes sure it is playable. 
After this the player is able to go around the map using WASD keys. The players character's orientation moves from left to right according to what has been pressed last, A or D. 
After player has collected all the collectibles the square with the exit renders a new image, indicating that the exit is now open and it is possible to finish the map. There is also a movement counter on the top left part of the screen.
